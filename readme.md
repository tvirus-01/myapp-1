Using live-server:
As a development web server we’re using live-server in this tutorial. live-server is a small web server with reload capabilities. It’s available as an npm package, so installation can be done with:

$ npm install -g live-server

Having completed the installation the command live-server is available. If you execute this command in the project directory the web server starts and our application opens in the browser.
